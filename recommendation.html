            <h1>Atomic Habits by James Clear üìí</h1>
            <h3>üí¨ What Are Habits?</h3>
            <p>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.
                And when we repeat errors, day after day, through replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and 
                rationalising little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results.</p>
            <h3>üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è 4 laws of behaviour change that we can use to create good habits and break bad ones!</h3>
            <p><b>Make it obvious</b> - the habit needs to be effortless for us and require no active thinking. For example, when I had a 
                hard time remembering to take my Vitamins. I realised that the problem was that I kept these pills on the inside a 
                drawer far from my bed. Once I put them in the obvious spot that I couldn't miss, I started taking them more regularly.</p>
            <p><b>Make it attractive</b> - if the habit is unattractive we likely won't have enough willpower to do it over and over. 
                Therefore, you should come up with some ways to make the habit attractive even if it's something hard like music practices
                 or studying for long hours. For me, it was studying with music, snacks, and a comfortable room.</p>
            <p><b>Make it easy</b> - the less friction there is between yourself and the habit, the greater the chances are that you‚Äôll 
                actually do it. This applies to simple things like packing your school bag a day before or preparing a healthy meal 
                to make sure that you don't order fastfood from deliver apps.</p>
            <p><b>Make it immediately satisfying</b> - our brain rewards immediate returns so it's good to come up with something 
                simple that brings us joy right after we perform our habit. Every time I study, I turn on some music and prepared snacks,
                 then studies for a couple hours. I know that it sounds a bit simple but this little routine makes me much more 
                 optimistic and relaxed about spending two hourse or three studying in my room.</p>
            <h3>‚è≥ It takes time to build a habit or break a bad one</h3>
            <p>Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time 
                your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy. If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, 
                it is not because you have lost your ability to improve.</p>
