    <h1>Genres</h1>
    <p>Here are the Three English Literature Genres. Every book in the Book Notes are based on these genres (1 Non-Fiction, 1 Fiction, and 1 Poetry). Enjoy!</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="LITHUB-col">
            <h3>Non-Fiction</h3>
            <p>The majority of books that are sold and read throughout the world are nonfiction books. Such books routinely top the New York Times bestseller
                 list and are consumed by everyone from academics, to hobbyists, to professionals. Nonfiction is a broad genre of writing that encompasses all 
                 books that aren't rooted in a fictional or made-up narrative. Some essential genres of non-fiction are history, biographies, memoirs, 
                 philosophy, insight, journalism, self-help, and guides. A favorite of mine from Non-Fiction is <b>Self-Improvement!</b></p>
        </div>
        <div class="LITHUB-col">
            <h3>Fiction</h3>
            <p>A work of fiction is created in the imagination of its author. The author invents the story and makes up the characters, the plot or 
                storyline, the dialogue and the setting. A fictional work does not claim to tell a true story. Instead, it immerses us in experiences 
                that we may never have in real life, introduces us to types of people we may never otherwise meet and takes us to places we may never 
                visit in any other way. Fiction can inspire us, intrigue us, scare us and engage us in new ideas. It can help us see ourselves and our 
                world in new and interesting ways. What's more, it's often just plain fun! A favorite of mine from Fiction is <b>Fantasy and Romance</b></p>
        </div>
        <div class="LITHUB-col">
            <h3>Poetry</h3>
            <p>Books in the poetry genre contain words that follow a rhythm or structure, and sometimes rhyme, that are designed on evoke emotion and 
                thought. Books can be, but aren't often written entirely in poetic form. Pilgrim's Progress and works by Dante are some of the best known 
                works of book length poetry. Other popular books in the poetry genre are known as ‚Äúchap books‚Äù and are collections of small poems. Some 
                favorites of mine are <b>"Shakespeare's Sonnets by William Shakespeare" and "The Complete Poems by Emily Dickinson".</b></p>

    <h1>Book Notes, Summaries, and Highlights</h1>
    <p>In this section, I wrote quick summaries from the three books above! For my most recommended book's summary, please check the <b>Recommendation</b> tab!</p>

            <h3>Atomic Habits - James Clear</h3>
            <p>Atomic Habits, is the best self-help book. Personally. This book helped me understand how habits are formed and what we can do to build 
                long-lasting chains of cues, cravings, responses, and rewards to create systems that will help us achieve our goals. To achieve our goals 
                we need to first build systems made of single processes and habits that will take us to our goals.</p>
            <p><b>A Quote from this Book: "Success is the product of daily habits, not once in a lifetime transformations."</b></p>

            <h3>Percy Jackson Series - Rick Riordan</h3>
            <p>Rick Riordan. One of the best author of fiction-fantasy and children's fiction. His works are never disappointing. The Percy Jackson series 
                takes Greek mythology into the 21st century, following a boy named Percy Jackson who discovers that he's a demigod ‚Äî part-human and 
                part-God ‚Äî and the son of mythological god of the sea, Poseidon. Rick has an amazing fictional writing skill that no other authors have. His
                books brings us inside his roller-coaster of immagination, which is something not many authors can do. Some lessons learned from this book is
                to have a back-up plan, never give up, trust and be loyal, carry yourself with confidence, and expect the unexpected.
            </p>
            <p><b>A Quote from this Book: "If my life is going to mean anything, I have to live it myself."</b></p>

            <h3>The 5AM Club - Robin Sharma</h3>
            <p>The 5AM Club presents a powerful argument for a work-rest routine to join the top 5% of performers. In the form of a story, the book argues 
                that a structured and consistent morning routine which starts at 5AM can act as a catalyst for greater productivity, health, and happiness. 
                Sharma also puts forward a variety of tactics for our working days to capitalise on our strong morning start, along with some fundamental 
                principles for world-class performance. There are four key ideas you get by reading this book, which consists of "The Four Focuses Of History
                Makers", "The Habbit Installation Protocoll", "The 20/20/20 Formula", and "The 10 Tactics of Lifelong Genius".</p>
