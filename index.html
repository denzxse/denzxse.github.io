            <h3>I'm Dennise. I'm a <u>Student</u>, Bookworm, Young-Musician, and <u>dream-to-be Doctor.</u></h3>
            <p>On this site we explore the genres, examples, benefits, and recommendations of books. Reading <br> books help us widen our range of vocabularies, live more productive lives, and improve our <br>writing skills (for any language). And over at Goodreads - a book review website - you can have <br>access to millions of books, and find your new favorite!</p>
            <p><b>Here, I'm gonna share my three favorite genres of books that you might want to try reading!</b></p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="LITHUB-col">
                    <h3>Non-Fiction</h3>
                    <p>The majority of books that are sold and read throughout the world are nonfiction books. Such books routinely top the New York Times bestseller
                         list and are consumed by everyone from academics, to hobbyists, to professionals. Nonfiction is a broad genre of writing that encompasses all 
                         books that aren't rooted in a fictional or made-up narrative. Some essential genres of non-fiction are history, biographies, memoirs, 
                         philosophy, insight, journalism, self-help, and guides. A favorite of mine from Non-Fiction is <b>Self-Improvement!</b></p>
                </div>
                <div class="LITHUB-col">
                    <h3>Fiction</h3>
                    <p>A work of fiction is created in the imagination of its author. The author invents the story and makes up the characters, the plot or 
                        storyline, the dialogue and the setting. A fictional work does not claim to tell a true story. Instead, it immerses us in experiences 
                        that we may never have in real life, introduces us to types of people we may never otherwise meet and takes us to places we may never 
                        visit in any other way. Fiction can inspire us, intrigue us, scare us and engage us in new ideas. It can help us see ourselves and our 
                        world in new and interesting ways. What's more, it's often just plain fun! A favorite of mine from Fiction is <b>Fantasy and Romance</b></p>
                </div>
                <div class="LITHUB-col">
                    <h3>Poetry</h3>
                    <p>Books in the poetry genre contain words that follow a rhythm or structure, and sometimes rhyme, that are designed on evoke emotion and 
                        thought. Books can be, but aren't often written entirely in poetic form. Pilgrim's Progress and works by Dante are some of the best known 
                        works of book length poetry. Other popular books in the poetry genre are known as ‚Äúchap books‚Äù and are collections of small poems. Some 
                        favorites of mine are <b>"Shakespeare's Sonnets by William Shakespeare" and "The Complete Poems by Emily Dickinson".</b></p>

                    <h3>Atomic Habits - James Clear</h3>
                    <p>Atomic Habits, is the best self-help book. Personally. This book helped me understand how habits are formed and what we can do to build 
                        long-lasting chains of cues, cravings, responses, and rewards to create systems that will help us achieve our goals. To achieve our goals 
                        we need to first build systems made of single processes and habits that will take us to our goals.</p>

                    <h3>Percy Jackson Series - Rick Riordan</h3>
                    <p>Rick Riordan. One of the best author of fiction-fantasy and children's fiction. His works are never disappointing. The Percy Jackson series 
                        takes Greek mythology into the 21st century, following a boy named Percy Jackson who discovers that he's a demigod ‚Äî part-human and 
                        part-God ‚Äî and the son of mythological god of the sea, Poseidon. Rick has an amazing fictional writing skill that no other authors have. His
                        books brings us inside his roller-coaster of immagination, which is something not many authors can do. Some lessons learned from this book is
                        to have a back-up plan, never give up, trust and be loyal, carry yourself with confidence, and expect the unexpected.

                    <h3>The 5AM Club - Robin Sharma</h3>
                    <p>The 5AM Club presents a powerful argument for a work-rest routine to join the top 5% of performers. In the form of a story, the book argues 
                        that a structured and consistent morning routine which starts at 5AM can act as a catalyst for greater productivity, health, and happiness. 
                        Sharma also puts forward a variety of tactics for our working days to capitalise on our strong morning start, along with some fundamental 
                        principles for world-class performance. There are four key ideas you get by reading this book, which consists of "The Four Focuses Of History
                        Makers", "The Habbit Installation Protocoll", "The 20/20/20 Formula", and "The 10 Tactics of Lifelong Genius".</p>

            <h1>This Month's Recommendation</h1>
            <p>This section covers two people's goodreads review of my most recommended book of the month, which is Atomic Habits!</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>This book is filled with practical steps and examples. Yes, there are plenty of habit-building books out there (just as there are plenty 
                            of diet books but yet there are still more new books published every year). Plenty of people are seeking the right book that resonates 
                            with them. The key points in this book are: "Compound Effect - Very small changes over time will have a big impact.", "Habit Building 
                            Techniques - Make good habits into routines; use positive reinforcements and other techniques outlined in the book.", and "Monitor and 
                            Measure - Keep track of your progress and improvements."</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>I was prepared to dislike this book but I really enjoyed it! I've seen it on so many list of "life-changing non fiction" next to deeply 
                            misogynistic authors and it's popular with people promoting hustle culture so I didn't expect it to work for me. While I can't say that 
                            the information in it is that different from other books I've read on the topic, it's definitely the best breakdown of said info that 
                            I've seen. Super accessible, bitesize chapters... absolutely go with the audiobook if you enjoy them. I didn't want to sit while reading
                             it because I was too busy reorganizing my space while listening to it! Worth it!</p>
